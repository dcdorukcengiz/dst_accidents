# dst_accidents
This repo includes all the codes, data, figures, tables related to day light saving time and accidents project by Doruk Cengiz and Serkan Demirkilic.

Currently, there are many scratch paper like .py scripts, but the relevant ones are also in the codes folder. 

The folder structure is pretty straightforward: 
DST_accidents/
├── codes/          # Scripts for data processing, analysis, and modeling
├── data/           # Raw and cleaned datasets (often excluded or sampled for GitHub)
├── figures/        # Generated figures and visualizations
├── tables/         # Output tables (e.g., regression results, summary stats)
├── writing/        # Drafts, notes, and manuscript files
├── output/         # Final outputs (combined datasets, logs, reports, etc.)
└── README.md       # Repository description and usage instructions
